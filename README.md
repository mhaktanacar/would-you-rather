# Getting Started with Create React App

This is a would you rather game app. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules. User can see his/her answered and unanswered questions, create new questions, answer existing questions and see the leaderboard table.
